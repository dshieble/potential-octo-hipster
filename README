How to use the GUI - 

Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom. Zooming is reversible, and always occurs based on the 
current center of the map.

Hold the mouse down and drag to move the map. Release the mouse to stop dragging.
Dragging happens continuously while the mouse is held down.

Click once on the map to highlight a nearest neighbor node, and click again to find a path. Click again to
find a new nearest neighbor node. Press the clear button at any time to restart the process.

Enter street names in the fields at the top of the screen to find a path via intersections.


Swag -
 
Our map displays the street names when it is zoomed in enough. In addition, our scrolling
happens continuously while the mouse is held down.


Optimizations - 

We optimized our canvas drawing by calling stroke only once for each color.

CheckStyle - 

Javadoc Package - 
This error is not included on the style guide.

EqualsHashCode -
I chose not to use a HashCode function because it introduced unusual PQ behavior.

Magic Number - The magic numbers that I use are:
-In my triemanager class, I return the top 5 suggestions
-In my GUIManager, I need to set the spark localhost port. I also need to ignore the
first 3 characters of each id when setting urls.
-In my Main class, I expect an args input that is 3 characters long
-In my PathFinder class, I need to parse all 5 of the columns returned by the resultSet.

JavaDocMethod -
For some reason, checkstyle is saying that I do not include the @throws tag for SQLException 
and ClassNotFoundException, even though I'm pretty sure that I do.


Bugs - 

This program has no known bugs


Design Details - 

The code for this project is split between the autocorrect and Trie packages, which handle
the autocorrection, the kd and stars packages, which handle nearest neighbor search,
and the maps package, which handles shortest path search, running the gui, parsing the REPL,
and running the traffic server.

The autocorrection and nearest neighbor packages are essentially unchanged. In order to place
nodes and ways in the KD tree and utilize the nearest neighbor search, we had the Node and Way classes
implement the KDimensional interface in the kd package.


Tests -

Our maps junit tests are located in the MapsTest.java file, and our stars junit tests 
are in the KDTreeTest.java, StarDatabaseTest.java and StarsTest.java files.
You can run them by running mvn package.

The system tests are located in the mytests file. You can run them with the 
cs032_system_tester_slow. Make sure to set a timeout of -t45.
